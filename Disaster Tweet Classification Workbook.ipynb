    "Our goal in this project was to make initial steps toward designing and implementing a web-tool or an app for tracking developments during a disastrous event, in close to real time.  While traditional methods for alerting on such events rely on official information derived from official sources (e.g. USGS), we were tasked here with attempting to utilize social media activity to identify these events and alert when an event first occurs.  The question we look at primarily here is, given a sea of text content from social media platforms, how do you identify what is relevant information for emergency response personnel?  And what sort of implementation would be valuable?"

    "Our initial plan was to try and real-time map incoming tweets using Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.  We quickly found that the APIs for these social media platforms have become much more restrictive than they used to be.  The limits on how many tweets we could get at one time were such that it wasn't feasible to build out a dataset that would support training a model.  We also could not get geolocation.  We needed a different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a useful dataset on the website CrisisLex, which collects datasets specific to NLP applications in disaster scenarios. This dataset contained tweet IDs for all geotagged tweets (6 million +) from affected areas of the Eastern Seaboard during the 11 day period surrounding Hurricane Sandy's landfall (10/22/2012-11/2/2012).  The tweets include all content, not just disaster-related tweets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use specific tweet IDs to pull dictionaries corresponding to the specific tweets.  Having specific tweet IDs also allows you to collect up to 900 tweets every fifteen minutes, which is much larger than the normal limit.  The fact that geotags with precise coordinates of sending location and timestamps to the second are included in the data is also very relevant, as it allows live-mapping, and accurately simulates the kind of information we would expect FEMA to have access to in this type of real-world application scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hurricanes, of all disasters, are probably the best-equipped to represent a generalizable lexicon, as hurricanes often involve a combination of flooding, fires, building damage/collapse, sufficient wind to down trees, explosions, injuries, deaths, trapped/stranded individuals, etc.  Obviously, the training data could be expanded to include a variety of disaster types in the future.\n",

    "- Sampling method: tweets were geotagged and located in Washington DC or one of 13 US states affected by Sandy: Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia,West Virginia. This filter was based on a set of bounding boxes that covered the desired area, which also covered small parts of adjacent states.\n",
    "- Labels: no labels. The corpus contains tweets both relevant and irrelevant to Hurricane Sandy (no content based filter was applied).\n",

While we could set up a Twython call to run through some number of indices in our id list, once it hit the 900 limit, it would continue to mow through indices without actually getting anything.  This 900 count includes the significant percentage (~25%) of these old Sandy tweets that have since been deleted and yield no information, they are still counted as tweet calls.  So basically we would move 900 indices through the tweet id list per pull, regardless. \n",

    "Our primary takeaways in this project thus far are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite initial setbacks, we were able to arrive at a satisfying and effective two-phase process for identifying critical disaster tweets out of the sea of all incoming tweets on social media. We were pleased with how well we were able to isolate potentially relevant tweets from a sea of test data. We also successfully visualized what an interface for receiving geotagged tweets in real-time might look like, although we expect a more integrated and multi-functional mapping software than Tableau might be necessary for real-world implementation. Finally, we were able to demonstrate proof-of-concept on live-streaming capture of tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given unrestricted access to the data available via Twitter, let alone Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram (all of which FEMA or a similar organization would likely have in the hypothetical scenario where they would implement this process), I feel we have demonstrated that it would be absolutely possible to build out a very useful and accurate geo-feed of emergency response information in the area of an ongoing disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal implementation perhaps would be to continually label critical tweets after the fact and progressively train for different types of emergency tweets over many documents and events.  Emergency personnel whose job it is to review the incoming tweets that the existing model has identified as critical could also be tasked with manually labeling the identified tweets as truly critical or not as they come in, with this labeling feeding back into actively improving the performance of the model as time goes on.  With enough development, we could reach a point where we have specialized models for different disaster types, which emergency personnel could turn on as appropriate once a disaster scenario is live.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this bodes well for future expansion of the project. Other directions we might go with more time include attempting to involve another social media platform, or locate a database of tweets from a disaster scenario other than a hurricane to try and diversify our filtering process. We also would like to try and improve predictive accuracy by use of Words2Vec, which is well equipped to locate similar types of tweets (e.g. critical tweets) without explicit labeling."
